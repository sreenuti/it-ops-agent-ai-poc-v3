  "instruction_text": "To diagnose and resolve laptop overheating:\n\n1. Check current temperature:\n   - Use monitoring software (HWiNFO, Core Temp, SpeedFan)\n   - Check BIOS temperature readings\n   - Monitor during normal use vs heavy load\n\n2. Physical inspection:\n   - Check air vents for blockage (dust, debris)\n   - Verify fans are spinning (listen for fan noise)\n   - Check if laptop is on soft surface blocking vents\n   - Ensure laptop is on hard, flat surface\n\n3. Clean cooling system:\n   - Power off and disconnect laptop\n   - Use compressed air to clean vents (hold fans while cleaning)\n   - Consider professional cleaning if heavily dusty\n   - Clean internal fans if accessible\n\n4. Check for high CPU usage:\n   - Task Manager > Performance tab\n   - Identify processes using high CPU\n   - End unnecessary processes\n   - Check startup programs\n\n5. Update drivers and BIOS:\n   - Update graphics drivers\n   - Update chipset drivers\n   - Check for BIOS updates from manufacturer\n   - Update power management drivers\n\n6. Adjust power settings:\n   - Control Panel > Power Options\n   - Change to 'Balanced' or 'Power Saver'\n   - Reduce maximum processor state (95% to 80%)\n   - Adjust cooling policy to 'Active'\n\n7. Check thermal paste (advanced):\n   - If laptop is older or recently opened\n   - Consider replacing thermal paste on CPU/GPU\n   - Best done by professional technician\n\n8. Use cooling pad:\n   - External laptop cooling pad with fans\n   - Elevate laptop for better airflow\n   - Ensure adequate space around laptop\n\n9. Monitor background processes:\n   - Disable unnecessary startup programs\n   - Close unused applications\n   - Check for malware consuming resources\n\n10. Check for hardware issues:\n    - Test if overheating occurs during specific tasks\n    - Check if battery is swollen (replace immediately)\n    - Verify fans are functioning (may need replacement)\n\n11. Software optimization:\n    - Reduce screen brightness\n    - Close resource-intensive applications\n    - Use performance mode only when needed\n    - Enable Windows performance mode adjustments\n\n12. Professional service:\n    - If persistent, may need fan replacement\n    - Check for hardware defects\n    - Consider warranty service if applicable",
